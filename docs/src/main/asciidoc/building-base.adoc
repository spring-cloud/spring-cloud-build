=== Basic Compile and Test

To build the source you will need to install
http://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Apache Maven] v3.0.6 or above and JDK {jdkversion}.

Spring Cloud uses Maven for most build-related activities, and you
should be able to get off the ground quite quickly by cloning the
project you are interested in and typing

----
$ mvn install -s .settings.xml
----

NOTE: You may need to increase the amount of memory available to Maven by setting
a `MAVEN_OPTS` environment variable with the value `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m`

The `.settings.xml` is only required the first time (or after updates
to dependencies). It is there to provide repository declarations so
that those do not need to be hard coded in the project poms.

For hints on how to build the project look in `.travis.yml` if there
is one. There should be a "script" and maybe "install" command. Also
look at the "services" section to see if any services need to be
running locally (e.g. mongo or rabbit).  Ignore the git-related bits
that you might find in "before_install" since they will be able git
credentials and you already have those.

If you need mongo, rabbit or redis, see the README in the https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/scripts[scripts
demo repository] for
instructions. For example consider using the "fig.yml" with
http://www.fig.sh/[Fig] to run them in Docker containers.

=== Documentation

The spring-cloud-build module has a "docs" profile, and if you switch
that on it will try to build asciidoc sources from
`src/main/asciidoc`. As part of that process it will look for a
`README.adoc` and process it by loading all the includes, but not
parsing or rendering it, just copying it to `${main.basedir}`
(defaults to `${basedir}`, i.e. the root of the project). If there are
any changes in the README it will then show up after a Maven build as
a modified file in the correct place. Just commit it and push the change.

=== Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
http://www.springsource.com/developer/sts[Spring Tools Suite] or
http://eclipse.org[Eclipse] when working with the code. We use the
http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin for maven support. Other IDEs and tools
should also work without issue.

==== Importing into eclipse with m2eclipse
We recommend the http://eclipse.org/m2e/[m2eclipe] eclipse plugin when working with
eclipse. If you don't already have m2eclipse installed it is available from the "eclipse
marketplace".

Once the projects are imported into Eclipse you will also need to tell m2eclipse
to use the `.settings.xml` file for the projects.  If you do not do this you may 
see errors many different errors related to the POMs in the projects. 
Open your Eclipse preferences, expand the Maven preferences, and select User Settings.  
In the User Settings field click Browse and navigate to the Spring Cloud project you
imported selecting the `.settings.xml` file in that project.  Click Apply and then OK to 
save the preference changes.

==== Importing into eclipse without m2eclipse
If you prefer not to use m2eclipse you can generate eclipse project metadata using the
following command:

[indent=0]
----
	$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
----

The generated eclipse projects can be imported by selecting `import existing projects`
from the `file` menu.

==== Adding Project Lombok Agent

Spring Cloud uses [Project
Lombok](http://projectlombok.org/features/index.html) to generate
getters and setters etc. Compiling from the command line this
shouldn't cause any problems, but in an IDE you need to add an agent
to the JVM. Full instructions can be found in the Lombok website. The
sign that you need to do this is a lot of compiler errors to do with
missing methods and fields, e.g.

[indent=0]
----

==== Importing into other IDEs
Maven is well supported by most Java IDEs. Refer to you vendor documentation.
